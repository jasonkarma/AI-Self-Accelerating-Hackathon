# Self-Accelerating Antibody Lead Optimization

Python implementation of the v1.2 Hybrid Virtual Lab. The bundled 419-row dataset is a clearly
marked deterministic synthetic fixture; replace it with the real AbBiBench export using
`python scripts/fetch_real_1n8z.py` before scientific evaluation.

## Quickstart

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/generate_benchmark_fixture.py
pytest -q
python scripts/run_benchmark.py --seeds 10
uvicorn app.server:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend clients on localhost:3000/5173 may call `GET /api/state`, `GET /api/candidates`,
`GET /api/benchmark`, and subscribe to `GET /api/stream-round`. CORS permits all origins.

The full race is `python scripts/run_benchmark.py --seeds 100`; ExtraTrees use all CPU cores.
Set `M5_POLICY_MODE=live_agent` to transparently stamp live-agent M5 runs, or leave the default
`adaptive_tool`. Set `HITL=1` for the human approval gate.

Frontier model slots accept OpenAI-compatible transports using role-prefixed variables such as
`AFFINITY_SCIENTIST_BASE_URL` and `AFFINITY_SCIENTIST_API_KEY`; requests set thinking mode and
high reasoning effort. Missing credentials safely select the deterministic reasoner.

## Install the official AbBiBench 1N8Z table

```bash
python scripts/fetch_real_1n8z.py
cat config/frozen_protocol.json
```

The fetcher uses direct Hugging Face Hub CSV downloads and therefore avoids `datasets`/`dill`
compatibility problems on Python 3.14. It validates and stages all files before an atomic swap.
The official table contains 419 measurements over 416 unique extracted HCDR3 sequences and no
measured `SRWGGDGFYAMDY` row; duplicates are preserved as experimental replicates, while WT remains
the label-blind developability threshold reference. Successful installation must report
`"is_synthetic": false`. When the dataset hash changes, prior campaign/benchmark artifacts are
archived with a `pre-real-<hash>` suffix to prevent mixed-provenance results.
